    WIN32 APPLICATION : winaudio Project Overview
========================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your winaudio application.


winaudio.cpp
    This is the main application source file and is the entry point. 
    This will start a window application and just dispatch all msg.

Blowfish
	This is a standard implementation of blowfish, which I have modified to suit my needs


AND a hell of a lot more files ... :)
