windows_keylogger
=================
This is a windows key logger using blow fish to save key-strokes written sometime during 2009 and intended only for academic use, to test different virus protection.

(Moved from HG)

How it is done
==============
Key strokes are not stored when they are pressed, because this usually gets noted directly by any good protection. Also the name of the binary should be something inconspicuous else it also will be noted. No std or any other libraries has been used.
